The extensions are distributed into 3 inboxes (New arrivals, Recently released, Recently upgraded), and into 8 categories:

- for inboxes, the extensions are ordered by publication date.

- for categories, the extensions order is based on a score which is the average number of downloads per week.

The mapping of extensions to categories is defined here: [extensions.js](extensions.js)

This webapp has been developped with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Embedded JavaScript templates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs), and the [extendng.castsoftware.com API](https://extendng.castsoftware.com/api/doc).
